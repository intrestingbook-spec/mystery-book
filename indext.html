    <h2>The Summons</h2>

    <div class="first">
      <p>Day 1, The drawing room. The five heirs have just heard the bizarre
         terms of the will and the threatening first recording from the 
         "deceased," Silas Bellweather. The atmosphere is hostile and terrified.
      </p>
    </div><br>

    <div class="dialogue">

      <div class="line trevor">
        <span class="name">Trevor</span>
        <p>(Pacing aggressively, running a hand through his expensive hair)</p><br>
        <p>
          This is insane. An explicit threat? A scavenger hunt?
          I have a multi-billion-dollar acquisition closing Friday.
          I will not be trapped in a gothic horror show with strangers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="line anya">
        <span class="name">Anya</span>
        <p>(Calmly folding her hands)</p><br>
        <p>
        The threat is serious, Mr. Vance. Bellweather clearly suggests 
        one of us had motive enough to kill him. We should be focused on finding the 
        connection. Where did you know Silas Bellweather from?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="line trevor">
        <span class="name">Trevor</span>
        <p>(Scoffs)</p><br>
        <p>
        I didn't. I received a certified letter from some shell 
        corporation naming me an heir. I assumed it was a standard legal fight. 
        Clearly, I assumed wrong.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="line chloe">
        <span class="name">Chloe</span>
        <p>(Whispering, intimidated by the grandeur of the room)</p><br>
        <p>
         I work at a coffee shop. In Portland. I spilled coffee on the wrong lawyer, 
         maybe? That's my only connection to high finance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="line marcus">
        <span class="name">Marcus</span>
        <p>(Scribbling furiously in a small notebook)</p><br>
        <p>
       Vellum said Bellweather died two months ago.
        If one of us killed him, the body is already cold.
         What we need to understand is why he left this maze.
          It's not about the money, it's about making a spectacle.
        And why five strangers?

      <div class="line sara">
        <span class="name">Sara</span>
        <p>(Staring out the window at the storm, her voice low and even)</p><br>
        <p>
       He needs us here. All five of us.
        If it were just about money, he would have left it to a foundation. 
        He set this up so we would tear the place, and each other, apart. 
        He built his fortune on chaos; he's distributing it the same way.
        </p>
      </div>
       <div class="line trevor">
        <span class="name">Trevor</span>
       
        <p>
         That's ridiculous, Sara. He built it on shrewd, cold business.
          You sound like a conspiracy theorist.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="line marcus">
        <span class="name">Marcus</span>
        <p>(Looking up sharply at Sara)</p><br>
        <p>
      Maybe she's right. If we're all pawns, we need to figure out the board.
       Before one of us becomes the next victim in his little game.

       The dates. They're all within three years of each other. 
       Five different mothers. Five different cities. All "Anonymous" fathers.
        But look at the signature on the back of Chloe's
         form-a notary stamp from Bellweather's old corporation.

      This wasn't a competition for money.

      Siblings who hate each other. Siblings who, thanks to him,
       now suspect one of us tried to kill the other. It's perfect.
        It strips away every ounce of humanity and forces us to be what he always was: ruthless.

       You-you pathetic fools! You actually choose justice over power?
        Anya, you could fund your own university! Marcus, you could buy the network

      Your authority is a lie, Silas. You faked your death to orchestrate
